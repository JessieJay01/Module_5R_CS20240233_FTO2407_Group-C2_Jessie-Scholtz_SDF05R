SDFO5 Project: CSS Button Styling

Project Outline:
1) I added a root at the top of my css file, including all the colours I'll be using for my buttons
2) I added my box sizing
3) I added transition timing for all 3 of my buttons
4) I added all the editing, animations, transitions and colours to all 3 of my buttons

I wanted my buttons to have a glow effect which I thought was quite cool and to have a solid colour when you hover over it.

This project was quite challenging for me, I battled with time management and to stay positive. At one point my code was not working and I redid everything a couple of times. But realised afterwords, I did not properly link my css file to my html. Also named my buttons incorrectly in my css file. But fixed it!

It all worked out in the end and I'm very chuffed with how my buttons came out. It could use some more work and improvement though.
